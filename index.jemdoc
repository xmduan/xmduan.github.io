Welcome to my personal website. I am a tenure track associate professor in the [https://sais.sjtu.edu.cn/ School of Automation and Intelligent Sensing] at [https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/ Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), China]. Before joining SJTU, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the [https://www.oden.utexas.edu/ Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences] at [https://www.utexas.edu/ the University of Texas, Austin], working with [https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/topcu Prof. Ufuk Topcu]. I obtained my PhD degree in [https://me.ucsb.edu/ Mechanical Engineering] at [https://www.ucsb.edu/ UC Santa Barbara]. 
My PhD advisor was [https://fbullo.github.io/ Prof. Francesco Bullo]. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Automation
from the [http://english.bit.edu.cn/ Beijing Institute of Technology] in 2013, and my Master's degree in Control Science and Engineering from [https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/ Zhejiang University] in 2016 under the supervision of
[https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/jmchen Prof. Jiming Chen]. My current research focuses on control, planning and decision-making for autonomous systems.
