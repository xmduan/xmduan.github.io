== About me
Welcome to my personal website. I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at UC Santa Barbara. 
I am honored to have a chance to work with [http://motion.me.ucsb.edu Prof. Francesco Bullo]. Before coming to UCSB, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Automation
from the [http://english.bit.edu.cn/ Beijing Institute of Technology] in 2013 and my Master's degree in Control Science and Engineering from [https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/ Zhejiang University] in 2016 under the supervision of
[http://www.sensornet.cn/ Prof. Jiming Chen]. My current research focuses on the design of stochastic surveillance algorithms for robotic systems.
